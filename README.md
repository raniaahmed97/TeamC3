## About :
We are a group of BI students working on the project of tutorial 16 for the SE course we're taking on our 6th semester. Each one of us is unique thus working together is both challenging and interesting. Rania, she loves travelling, surfing the internet and of course coding. Karen, she likes talking with different people and getting to know different backgrounds. Nadine, she loves reading more than anything else. Last but not least, Ola, she also loves travelling and likes shopping so much. The purpose of this repo is to contain all our work that we collaborate on to ease communication between us. WE ARE SO LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS SE COURSE!!!
